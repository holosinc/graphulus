# graphulus
An application to experiment with graphs exploration and virtual reality, made using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) for the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) and the [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/).

Graphs are placed in the 3D virtual space using a [force-directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) layout, and can be manipulated through hand gestures (i.e., single pinches to move nodes around and double pinches to move and scale the graph).

To start the application, play the scene `SceneVRLP.unity` (don't forget to tick `Virtual Reality Supported` in the Unity editor located in `Edit > Project Settings > Player`). If you don't have an Oculus or a Leap Motion device, you can play with the scene `Scene.unity`, where the graph can be controlled using mouse and keyboard.   
Both scenes have been tested with Unity v5.3.5f1, Oculus Rift DK2 with Runtime v1.5.0 and Leap Motion Orion v3.1.3.
