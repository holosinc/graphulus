Experiments about graphs exploration and virtual reality with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), for the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) and the [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/).

Graphs are loaded from JSON files and placed in the 3D virtual space using a [force-directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) layout. The application can be started in two different scenes:
- Play `Scene.unity` (used during development for testing purposes) if you don't have an Oculus Rift or a Leap Motion Controller. The camera can be controlled with the `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` keys and the mouse, but the graph cannot be manipulated. Settings can be altered by the following key bindings:
  - `R` toggles edges active
  - `T` toggles labels active
  - `N` toggles auto rotation
  - `B` increases auto rotation speed
  - `V` decreases auto rotation speed
  - `L` toggles theme
- Play `SceneVRLP.unity` for the VR experience. The camera is controlled by the Oculus Rift, and the graph can be manipulated by the Leap Motion Controller in two ways: use single pinches to move nodes around, and double pinch to move/scale/rotate the whole graph. Look down to activate the menu, and interact with its elements by gazing for a brief period of time. Do not forget to check `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Virtual Reality Supported` in the Unity editor.

This project has been developed and tested with Unity v5.3.5f1, Oculus Rift DK2 with Rift Runtime v1.5.0 and Leap Motion Orion v3.1.3.
